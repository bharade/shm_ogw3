## Project Overview

This project explores the application of data-driven methods for predicting the extent of damage in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems. A key challenge in SHM is the scarcity of high-quality, noise-free data. To address this, this research introduces a novel approach that integrates **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) augmentation** with **transformer regression** for guided wave damage extent prediction.

Traditional SHM methods can be time-consuming and insufficient for detecting early-stage damage. By leveraging machine learning techniques to analyse complex time series data generated by SHM systems, more efficient and scalable solutions can be developed. This project focuses on processing raw guided wave responses, augmenting the data samples, and deploying a transformer-based model for damage prediction.

## Motivation

Traditional SHM methods often rely on manual inspections or basic sensor-based systems, which are time-consuming, costly, and may not detect damage in its early stages. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques like guided waves generate complex time series data requiring careful analysis. Machine learning can handle large datasets more efficiently than traditional techniques. However, obtaining high-quality, organised, and noise-free data for various damage conditions is a significant challenge in data-driven SHM. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a novel method for creating synthetic data for guided waves using a CVAE.

## Methodology

The study involved the following key steps:

*   **Data Acquisition:** Lamb wave signal data for varying damage sizes was obtained from the **Open Guided Waves (OGW) repository**. Specifically, the third dataset, consisting of guided wave signals of a CFRP plate with an omega stringer and simulated damage of varying sizes, was used.
*   **Data Pre-processing:** Raw signal data was cleansed and denoised using MATLAB, involving a Butterworth high-pass filter and downsampling. Only the T3-T9 differential signals were considered for computational efficiency [12-14]. The 1D discrete data points were scaled to the interval [-1, 1] using min-max scaling.
*   **Data Augmentation:** A **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** was employed to augment the guided wave signals for different damage extents and excitation frequencies. The CVAE was conditioned on the frequency and damage class to generate synthetic signals, effectively doubling the dataset size for the D1 damage location.
*   **Model Architecture:** A **transformer-based architecture** was leveraged to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal patterns in the processed guided wave signals. The architecture utilised a self-attention mechanism and convolutional layers [27-29]. The task was modelled as both a **regression** and a **classification** problem.
    *   For **classification**, the model used categorical cross-entropy loss and a softmax activation in the final layer to predict one of the 14 damage states (including undamaged).
    *   For **regression**, two cases were considered: predicting absolute damage sizes and normalised damage sizes. The model used Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and a sigmoid activation was used in the final layer for the normalised case.
*   **Model Training and Evaluation:** The models were trained using the Adam optimiser for 500 epochs, with 80% of the augmented data used for training and 20% for validation. Performance was evaluated on an unseen test set using appropriate metrics for classification (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) and regression (Explained Variance Score, Median Absolute Error, R2 Score, MSE, RMSE, MAE).

## Results

The key findings of the study are:

*   **Classification:** The transformer-based model achieved a classification **accuracy of 68.63%** on unseen test data. The classification report provides detailed precision, recall, and F1-scores for each damage class.
*   **Regression (Absolute Labels):** The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **1.360** on the test set after 500 epochs.
*   **Regression (Normalised Labels):** The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **1.875** on the test set after 500 epochs. Normalising labels helped to mitigate overfitting observed with absolute labels.

These results demonstrate the promise of the integrated CVAE augmentation and transformer regression approach for accurately predicting the extent of structural damage using guided waves.

## How to Use (Conceptual)

This project provides a framework for damage extent prediction. To use this framework:

1.  Obtain guided wave signal data from a structure of interest.
2.  Pre-process the data using similar techniques as described in the report (filtering, downsampling, scaling).
3.  Train a CVAE model on the pre-processed data, conditioned on damage characteristics and operational parameters, to augment the dataset.
4.  Train a transformer-based regression or classification model on the augmented data to predict the extent of damage.
5.  Evaluate the trained model on unseen data to assess its performance.

**Note:** Specific implementation details, code, and further instructions are not included in this README but would be part of the full project documentation.

## Future Work

Future research directions include:

*   Ensembling multiple unique encoder units to improve feature extraction from complex Lamb wave responses.
*   Extending the model to multi-class tasks such as damage localisation and severity assessment.
